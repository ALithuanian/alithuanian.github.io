## Overview

Music streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music have rapidly grown in popularity over recent years, accounting for almost 50% of music consumption globally. Moving forward, these platform and Spotify in particular, with its dominant position and market share, will continue to expand and attract new listeners, transforming the way in which people everywhere interact with music.	
While recommender systems in general have been a popular and crucial area of study and technological development, the application of recommender systems to song discovery in particular has been a uniquely important and challenging endeavor. Unlike movies, online articles, or advertisements, songs are frequently listened to in succession, where the consumer wants little, if any, trouble expending time and energy in manually searching for and selecting a new song every 3-5 minutes for hours at a time. Consequently, recommender systems for music streaming are especially crucial. 

Moreover, music playlist generation is especially impactful - whereas a user may only commit to watching 1 movie on any given day, the duration of music consumption is frequently much more flexible with high caliber playlists extending user engagement during the session in question as well as user engagement with the platform beyond that particular session. This is, in turn, critical for the development of platforms like Spotify, especially as they see inflection points in user growth in the upcoming years and must focus more so than ever on curating high quality playlists and experiences for each user. Automated song discovery will be increasing essential to Spotifyâ€™s core operations as the platform further scales globally, relying more so on efficient and high caliber machine led playlist curation. Playlists are the best way to showcase the core product of music streaming platforms and ultimately drive user growth and retention.

A sample Spotify playlist can be explored below

## Problem Statement
Through this project, we aim to accomplish the following: 

1. Develop a new understanding of the process of song discovery - the relevant variables, most predictive attributes, most effective grouping mechanisms, and the effectiveness of the same model of different playlist groupings

2. Create a novel method for automated song discovery, generating a playlist for users based on existing song preferences and their characteristics along dimensions, such as emotion, intent, and geography

In particular, we output a list of candidate tracks for the recommended playlist, ordered by relevance in descending order
